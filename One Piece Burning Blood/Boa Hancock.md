# Full Guide (WIP, not organized, might have errors)

- the string U, U, R1, A, ... can work without the R1 but is very inconsistent and for that reason combos that use it will have R1 mentioned


## All combos

- 2U, delay, AW
- 2U, Sp.G, ...
- A, A, A, A, A, A
- A, A > AW
- A, A, A > AW (must cancel early)
- A, A, A, A > AW
- U, U, A, A, A, A > AW
- U, U, U, R1, A, A, A, A, U, U, Sp.A
- U, U, U, R1, A, A, A, A, A, AW


### Incosistent - Not worth doing

- U, U, A, A, A, A, U, U, Sp.A

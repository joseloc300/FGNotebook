# Starter Guide VS

## cr.MK, qcb\*P
- spam st.LP after cr.MK
  - if the L version is used, st.LP wont come out because its a true blockstring but you can punish after since its -4 on block
  - if the M version is used, there is a 5f gap and its -5/-6 on block so you can punish after cr.MK or after qcb.MK
  - if H or PP version is used, st.LP will come out in the gap between the 2 attack and you can punish. if you missed this you cant punish after since its +2/+3 on block
  - if there is denjin charge, you can punish all between cr.MK and qcb.\*P \(including PP\) but cant after since they all are + on block
- Punish:
  - use a 4f punish to cover all options
  - reminder that punish after is punish-counter \(+4f\) but punish between the is only counter-hit \(+2f\)

# Matchups

## Blanka

- st.MK or 4.HP to anti-air blanka ball. 4.HP is safer in terms of hurtbox and you can use it very early.  
On the other hand st.MK is faster which makes it better to use on reaction and safer on whiff if blanka ball doesn't connect.  
Available combos below
  - st.MK, qcf.MK
  - st.MK, qcf.KK, etc (if qcf.KK is used too soon Lv2 can whiff)
  - st.MK, Lv1/Lv2/Lv3
  - 4.HP, Lv1/Lv2/Lv3
  - 4.HP, qcb.KK, Lv3
  - 4.HP, qcf.HK
  - 4.HP, qcf.KK, etc (if qcf.KK is used too soon Lv2 can whiff)
  - 4.HP, 22.HK

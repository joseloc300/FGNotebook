    Notes: 
        - A1 must be called immediatly after Goku SSGSS switches sides during 214H, aka after 1st teleport. The combo will drop if this is done too early or too late. <br>
        - 5H after Vanish must also be delayed but the time window is quite forgiving so you can eyeball it pretty easily.
